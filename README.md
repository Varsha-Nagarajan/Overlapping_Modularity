# Overlapping_Modularity


This provides an implementation of Overlapping Modularity as proposed in the paper 
"Nicosia V, Mangioni G, Carchiolo V and Malgeri M 2009 Extending the definition of
modularity to directed graphs with overlapping communities J. Stat. Mech. P03024"
The same "twoâ€“dimensional logistic function" as mentioned in the paper has been used
and the values for p in equation 23 is taken as suggested in 
Nicosia V, Mangioni G, Carchiolo V and Malgeri M 2008 Extending modularity definition for
directed graphs with overlapping communities arXiv:0801.1647
